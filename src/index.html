                            <p>Professional Closing &amp; Title Services throughout the State of Florida.
                                In today&#39;s complicated world, property owners need title protection more
                                than ever. A deed to a piece of property does not necessarily prove that
                                the seller is the owner of the property. The will or deed could be forged,
                                undisclosed heirs could lay claim to the land, or errors in clerical work
                                could endanger a person&#39;s legal title to his land.</p>

                            <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
                            <p>Our philosophy is that the closing should be a happy event where parties get together to
                                sign documents. If your experience with other title companies is anything but that, then
                                you should try First Choice and see the difference. We are a family owned and
                                operated business and each transaction is treated with the unique attention it deserves.
                                Additionally, First Choice has an in-house attorney, Mr. Eugene Vigoa, who is the head
                                of our legal department and is more than happy to assist you during your transactions.
                                He is always just a telephone call away.</p>

                                <p>Title insurance is a contractual obligation between a homeowner and/or lender and the title insurance company, wherein the insurer, in exchange for a premium payment, provides protection against future losses that might
                                    result from a variety of possible title defects or encumbrances that existed at the time of closing.</p>
